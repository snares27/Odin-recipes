    <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cumin powder</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
    <li>1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons california chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1⁄4 teaspoon oregano</li>
    <li>4 cups canned white hominy, drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>3 -5 cups pork broth, from cooking pork shoulder</li>
    <li>1 cup canned diced green chilis (optional)</li>
    <li>2 whole fresh jalapenos, chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>whole ancho chilies, seeded and stemmed (garnish) (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p2>Steps</p2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the onion, peel the garlic, chop the onion, peel and chop the 2 garlic cloves, chop the green chilies and jalapenos if you are using them and get the hominy drained and rinsed.</li>
    <li>I boil my ancho chilies in a separate small pot for the garnish part(read below).
    </li>
    <li>Now you are ready to cook.
    </li>
    <li>Place the meat in a large saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water.
    </li>
    <li>Add 1/2 chopped onion, the 2 cloves peeled garlic, pepper, cumin, and oregano.
    </li>
    <li>Bring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that rises, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove meat and broth, reserving both.
    </li>
    <li>Saute the remaining chopped onion and garlic in oil until translucent.
    </li>
    <li>Add the remaining spices, stir for a minute.
    </li>
    <li>Cut the reserved pork into 1 inch cubes and add to the pan.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in the canned hominy, pork broth (if there is not enough pork broth, add chicken stock, I like to add it anyway for flavor, about 2-4 cups, eyeball the amount you like), green chilies and jalapenos (optional).
    </li>
    <li>Cook at a simmer, covered, for 45 to 60 minutes until the meat and hominy are tender.
    </li>
    <li>If necessary, cook for up to an additional 60 minutes until the chilies and onions are well blended into the broth.
    </li>
    <li>Degrease the stew, taste for salt, and serve in soup bowls.
    </li>
</ol>
<p2>Garnishes</p2>
<ul>
    <li>Lemon</li>
    <li>Sliced Radishs</li>
    <li>Chopped Cilantro</li>
    <li>Corn Tortillas</li>
</ul>
<p2>Red Salsa</p2>
<body>When my ancho chilies are soft from boiling(takes about 15 minutes), 
    then i put them in the blender with 1 1/2cups of water, 1 clove of garlic and about 
    2 tablespoons diced onion, and about 1 tablespoons of salt and pepper. I blend this thin, 
    then strain it to get the liquid separated from its "pulp". I throw the pulp into the soup for the 
    flavor i like but you can discard if too spicy for you. The remaining liquid you put in a serving dish 
    for guests to add in their own bowl, if desired. Beware! It's HOT!</body>
